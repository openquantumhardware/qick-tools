Xilinx XFFT block, 16 parallel blocks, 16384 points each.

The output m_axis interface will route tvalid, tlast and tuser from xfft 0.
They are all synced together as input valid is shared.

Tuser has the XK index to simplify post-processing, as output bins are bit-reversed
to allow saving half the memory.
